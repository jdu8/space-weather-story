ACT 2: THE MODERN AGE (Pages 9-16) 

9. Humans Evolve - Time-lapse: campfires → candles → gas lamps → electric lights 
10. 1859 Carrington Event - Fiery creates the most powerful auroras ever recorded 
11. Telegraph Chaos - Wires spark, operators shocked, paper catches fire - first tech casualty 
12. The Technological Explosion - Satellites, power grids, GPS, internet fill Earth's orbit 
13. Modern CME Strike - Fiery arrives as always, doing what she's always done 
14. Technology Fails - Satellites tumble, transformers blow, GPS signals vanish 
15. Human Fear - News alerts, emergency broadcasts, panic in cities 
16. Fiery's Confusion - "Why are they scared? They used to dance when I visited..." 

ACT 3: UNDERSTANDING & RESILIENCE (Pages 17-24) 

17. Scientists Observe - Space telescopes (SOHO, SDO) watch the Sun constantly 
18. Early Warning Systems - We can now predict Fiery's arrival 1-3 days ahead 
19. Hardened Satellites - Engineers build radiation shielding, redundant systems 
20. Protected Power Grids - Transformers with surge protection, grid operators prepare 
21. Astronaut Safety - ISS protocols: shelter in protected modules during CME 
22. Communication Backups - Undersea cables, ground-based systems as alternatives
