GENERATION TIPS:
- Use consistent art style across related images (all Fiery sprites, all characters, etc.)
- Maintain color palette consistency (refer to hex codes provided)
- For transparent PNGs, specify "transparent background, PNG format"
- For full backgrounds, specify "full bleed image, JPEG format"
- Test Fiery character consistency by generating sprite 001 first, then reference it
- Consider generating in batches by category for style consistency
- Educational accuracy important for scientific diagrams and cultural representations

Total Asset Count: 57 images
Priority: Generate Fiery sprites (001-006) first for character consistency
